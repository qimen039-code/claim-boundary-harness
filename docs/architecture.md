# Architecture

Claim Boundary Harness has four layers.

## 1. Root Microkernel

`AGENTS.md` is the smallest always-on rule set. It asks the agent to classify work before loading large context:

- task type;
- active project lane;
- evidence needs;
- memory boundary;
- risk boundary.

The microkernel should stay short. Put project details elsewhere.

## 2. Embedded Harness

`skills/embedded-harness` contains local scripts:

- `harness_intake_router.ps1`;
- `harness_memory_isolation_gate.ps1`;
- `harness_external_research_gate.ps1`;
- `harness_claim_schema_verifier.ps1`;
- `embedded_harness_policy.json`.

The intake router classifies work into R0-R5 internally and returns required gates. User-facing surfaces stay silent by default unless the classification changes execution path, cost, permission, memory, search, or claim boundaries.

The repository also includes adapter examples outside the core skill folder, such as `integrations/workbuddy-python-runtime`. These adapters should be treated as host-specific references. They can reuse the same `embedded_harness_policy.json`, but they do not change the core framework contract unless the adopting runtime actually calls them at the right execution boundary.

The mandatory advisory control plane sits around the router:

```text
routing receipt
-> intake route and cheapest sufficient gate selection
-> event-triggered re-evaluation
-> final claim, memory, version, and verification boundary check
-> selective hard runtime gate only for critical risks
```

The control plane decides whether to use project instructions, a project router, memory retrieval, existing skills/tools/plugins, external research, claim checks, or human confirmation. It should not expand into every memory, every skill, or every tool call by default.

## Hook Capture Point Matrix

Adopters can map the control plane onto host lifecycle hooks when the runtime exposes them. These stages capture the right context at the right time; they are not a requirement to run a full memory backend.

| Capture point | Main purpose | Harness action | Default cost boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `session_start` | Rehydrate only the minimum active lane context. | Read root instructions and memory meta index when needed. | Meta/index only; no payload scan. |
| `user_prompt_submit` | Preserve the original user task before tools lose context. | Build route receipt, classify memory/search/claim needs, store compact prompt state if hooks support it. | Compact receipt; no full history. |
| `pre_tool` | Stop or warn before protected actions. | Enforce R5, low-confidence route review, memory write, high-risk command, and external-search requirements. | Hard only on hooked paths. |
| `post_tool` | Capture what actually happened. | Store observations, tool failures, or candidate CE records as raw or working memory; do not mark success as validated without evidence. | Raw observation or working memory only. |
| `pre_compact` | Avoid context-compression loss. | Write a conversation checkpoint or open-loop summary when routed. | Summary and links only. |
| `stop` / `final` | Prevent final overclaims and decide durable updates. | Run final claim boundary, update memory only when routed, and record remaining verification debt. | Claim schema plus optional capsule update. |

If a host lacks one of these hooks, keep that stage advisory and record the missing surface in the compatibility manifest.

## Router Decision Contract

The router and dynamic decision layer use a compact contract before opening deeper modules:

```text
task_type
target_surface
audience
project_lane
risk_level
semantic_ambiguity
module_need
memory_need
memory_mode
memory_lane
record_intent
external_need
claim_risk
projectization_decision
required_gates
```

This contract keeps the decision layer stronger than a suggestion while avoiding full runtime wrapping. It tells the agent which surface is being touched, who the content is for, whether a term is ambiguous, which module to open, whether memory or external lookup is needed, and whether the final answer needs a claim schema.

The design borrows a few lightweight patterns: separate decision from execution, run prechecks before critical boundaries, route by metadata, reassess on trigger events, preflight likely failure modes, and keep audience/ownership explicit. These are design influences, not proof that this framework is validated in every runtime.

## Receipt Profile Layer

The full receipt schema remains the canonical governance model, but runtime adapters do not need to expose every field on every turn. The router computes the full decision and selects a profile:

- `compact_runtime`: default low-cost output for local agent loops. It carries the fields needed to enforce R5, memory route, external search budget, claim gate, and confirmation.
- `extended_governance`: public repository, local harness, adapter, project memory, semantic ambiguity, memory write, or projectization work.
- `debug_receipt`: full route diagnostics and trigger evidence.

This mirrors a common systems pattern: keep the policy decision point complete, but keep risk labels silent by default and expand emitted context only when the execution boundary needs it.

See [router-decision-contract.md](router-decision-contract.md).

## Declarative Governance Contract

Adapters can publish a small governance contract that declares which stages they support and what each stage must honor:

```text
prompt_stage
pre_tool
memory_access
external_research
final_claim
```

The contract is not a new runtime layer. It is a leverage point that lets adopters check the minimum adapter promises without loading every skill, memory file, or tool schema.

The contract should cover:

- stage support;
- decision vocabulary: `allow`, `warn`, `require_approval`, `deny`;
- minimum receipt fields;
- denial payload and blocked exit code;
- payload safety;
- cost profile.

See [declarative-governance-contract.md](declarative-governance-contract.md) and `templates/adapter-contract/governance.contract.json`.

## Version Compatibility Manifest

Adapters can also publish a compact compatibility manifest for the target runtime/client version. It records what was checked, not what is assumed.

The manifest should cover:

- runtime and adapter versions;
- instruction entry;
- hook schema;
- wrapper paths and language availability;
- denial behavior;
- payload safety checks;
- minimum acceptance results;
- bypass surfaces;
- drift policy.

Do not refresh this manifest every turn. Refresh it on adapter install, client update, hook/wrapper edits, failed smoke tests, or explicit user request.

See [version-compatibility-management.md](version-compatibility-management.md) and `templates/adapter-contract/compatibility.manifest.json`.

## Memory Routing Contract

Memory use has its own routed decision:

```text
memory_need
memory_mode
memory_lane
record_intent
projectization_decision
```

This prevents the framework from treating every mistake as permanent memory or every memory mention as a full history read. Common small mistakes can be stored as lightweight CE error-and-solution records. Full ERR/SOL pairs are reserved for explicit self-reflection requests, high-impact incidents, or repeated failures.

See [memory-routing-contract.md](memory-routing-contract.md) and [common-error-corpus.md](common-error-corpus.md).

Memory retrieval results should preserve provenance. A selected record should return at least these fields alongside the snippet: `source_tag` `derived_from` `belief_status` `confidence` `score_method`. A relevance score can rank candidates, but it does not turn a raw observation or source prior into a validated claim.

## Conversation Memory Lane

Projectless long conversations can use a separate conversation memory lane when the router detects explicit checkpoint instructions or durable long-chat signals:

```text
conversation-memory/_META_INDEX.md
-> conversation_state.md or index.json
-> decisions.jsonl / open_loops.jsonl / errors_and_solutions.jsonl / references.jsonl
```

This lane is isolated by conversation or thread id. It can be read by later conversations only through explicit reference, and cross-conversation writes require explicit user instruction. If the work becomes a real project, the router should mark `projectization_decision: emergent_project_candidate` instead of silently mixing conversation memory into project memory.

Conversation memories use stable `memory_id`, `updated_at`, index-level retrieval terms, and append-only links. A later conversation can continue an old one through a `continues` edge without writing new content into the old lane. Explicit merges create a new merged memory and link old memories into it.

See [conversation-memory-lane.md](conversation-memory-lane.md) and [memory-linking-contract.md](memory-linking-contract.md).

## Static Knowledge Layer

Projects may also keep a static knowledge layer for stable repository manuals:

```text
static-knowledge-layer/_STATIC_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md
-> project-map.md
-> entrypoints-and-commands.md
-> conventions.md
-> interfaces-and-data.md
```

This layer is not a memory backend and not a validation source by itself. It is a
low-cost orientation layer for module maps, entry points, commands, conventions,
and interface notes. Static notes should be returned with `source_tag:
static_knowledge`, `belief_status: source_prior`, `derived_from`, `confidence`,
and `score_method` metadata.

Use it when a task needs project navigation. Use the memory library when a task
needs decisions, incidents, evolving state, or source-monitoring capsules. A
static page can point to memory records, but it should not copy volatile memory
payloads by default.

See [static-knowledge-layer.md](static-knowledge-layer.md).

## Format Layering

The framework uses Markdown for human-facing docs and meta summaries, but machine-owned facts should use structured formats:

```text
Markdown -> public explanation, meta index, short capsules
JSON -> router policy and machine-readable indexes
JSONL -> append-only decisions, open loops, errors, solutions, references
CSV/TSV -> large tabular matrices
SQLite -> larger queryable local state
```

See [format-layering.md](format-layering.md).

## Cost Control Contract

The framework keeps a complete internal contract but emits only the smallest useful receipt:

```text
R0 -> no explicit receipt
R1/R2 -> compact runtime receipt
R3/R4 -> compact receipt plus triggered fields
R5 / public / archive / persona / memory write / debug -> extended or debug receipt
```

After the initial receipt, event-triggered re-evaluation should emit a delta receipt with changed fields only. A field belongs in the default receipt only if it changes the next action.

See [cost-control-contract.md](cost-control-contract.md).

## Archive And Persona Boundaries

Global archive is optional cold storage. It is checked after active project or conversation memory, not before. Archive defaults to moving or copying source files/directories so provenance stays intact.

Persona state is conversation-only and default-off. It may shape tone inside an ordinary conversation, but it cannot influence factual claims, risk, verification, project boundaries, memory boundaries, external research, claim schema checks, or tests.

See [archive-and-persona-boundaries.md](archive-and-persona-boundaries.md).

## Selective Runtime Enforcement Layer

The framework becomes hard runtime only for selected critical boundaries when an adopting agent routes execution through the runtime entry scripts:

```text
pre-task hook
-> harness_runtime_enforcer.ps1
-> task route, dynamic evaluation, constitution check

tool-call proxy
-> harness_tool_proxy.ps1
-> high-risk tool-call check

command wrapper
-> harness_task_wrapper.ps1
-> route check before command execution

final-answer gate
-> harness_runtime_enforcer.ps1 -Stage final
-> claim schema check for strong claims; PowerShell callers may pass actual response text with -FinalText
```

Hard-stop conditions:

- R5 without explicit human confirmation.
- Low-confidence route without boundary review.
- Nontrivial task with no available constitution entry.
- High-risk tool call without explicit human confirmation.
- Long-term memory write without explicit user request.
- Final strong claim without claim schema evidence boundary.

Ordinary tool calls should stay on the advisory control plane. This is not a sandbox. If an agent bypasses the hook, wrapper, or tool proxy, the scripts cannot stop it.

The wrapper is truly mandatory only when it is the agent's sole command execution path for the protected action. If a user, client feature, or separate tool path can bypass the wrapper, the framework remains advisory for that path.

Most gates are advisory by design: they return structured decisions that the caller must actively honor. Only paths configured to run through `harness_task_wrapper.ps1`, `harness_tool_proxy.ps1`, or an equivalent hook before execution become real interception points.

## Search And Learning Decision Matrix

External research is split into route types so the agent does not treat all outside lookup as the same operation:

| Route | Evidence surface | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Official / authority source search | official docs, public notices, policy, law, price, version, release date, named role | current fact with source boundary |
| GitHub / open-source repository search | README, source tree, release notes, issues, changelog, license, examples | repository-grounded evidence with reuse boundary |
| General web cross-check | independent articles, tutorials, ecosystem notes, community reports | cross-checked public context with source limits |
| Source-grounded learning intake | external mechanism, external architecture comparison, learn-from-open-source task | source ledger plus classification labels |
| Local validation route | local files, scripts, tests, reproduction, smoke checks | local evidence boundary for strong claims |

The learning classifier uses these labels:

```text
fact
source_prior
hypothesis
inspiration
unverified_implementation_path
not_applicable
local_validated
```

This keeps external learning useful without letting it become an unsupported local success claim.

## 3. Skill Tree

The skill tree has a router and three ledgers:

- `troubleshooting-skill-matrix`: routes incidents, anchors, and project manifests.
- `agent-error-memory`: stores agent-caused process errors.
- `bug-solution-memory`: stores solution patterns.
- `shared-semantic-anchors`: stores user-confirmed meanings and boundaries.

The ledgers start empty in this whiteboard package.

## 4. Project Templates

`templates/project` contains a project instruction file and a memory-library skeleton. Each adopting project should copy and edit these templates instead of placing private project content into the shared core.

## Layered Memory Library

Project memory is intentionally not a single flat summary file. A flat file is cheap at first, but it becomes another overloaded history blob as records grow. The mandatory retrieval path is:

```text
memory-library/_META_INDEX.md
-> choose one category or link ledger
-> category/_INDEX.md / memory_links.jsonl
-> open only the matching capsule
```

Do not skip the meta index. If a project has no meta index yet, use the smallest available top-level index or router manifest as a temporary meta layer and mark the missing layer as an adoption gap.

The default categories are:

- `governance`: project rules, decision records, boundaries, and operating contracts.
- `memory_hierarchy`: reusable memory capsules, active context, progress notes, and supersession chains.
- `external_references`: source notes, outside mechanisms, citations, and adoption boundaries.
- `raw_logs`: raw or near-raw observations that should not be treated as final memory.

Each category index should keep records small and searchable:

```text
ID | Type | Status | Summary | Retrieval Terms | Applies | Not Applies | Linked Modules | Linked Records | Supersedes | Superseded By
```

Recommended status values:

- `ACTIVE`: currently preferred record.
- `SUPERSEDED_BY:<ID>`: replaced by a newer record.
- `DEPRECATED`: retained for audit value but not used as current guidance.
- `TEMPLATE`: example or placeholder only.

When a new capsule replaces an old one, update both sides: the old row should point to `SUPERSEDED_BY:<ID>`, and the new row should declare `Supersedes`. This keeps long-horizon memory auditable without forcing the agent to reread old records on every task.

See [../examples/memory-library-demo/_META_INDEX.md](../examples/memory-library-demo/_META_INDEX.md) for a synthetic end-to-end example.

For the full recommended index fields and retrieval budget, see [memory-meta-index-contract.md](memory-meta-index-contract.md).

## Routing Model

```text
R0 ordinary response
R1 read-only inspection
R2 durable artifact
R3 code or config change
R4 experiment, runtime, or current source work
R5 high-risk action requiring confirmation
```

Routing is additive. A task can match R3 and R4 at the same time. The router keeps the highest label and returns all required gates.

## Boundary

The harness is advisory unless connected to a wrapper or hook system. It produces structured decisions, but the caller must honor them.

Even after hook or wrapper integration, enforcement is limited to paths that actually invoke the scripts. Use local smoke checks after agent client updates because launch paths, hook behavior, and bundled runtimes can change.

Do not treat this layer as a hard sandbox. If an agent still has a direct execution route that bypasses the wrapper or tool proxy, the hard stop degrades back to advisory for that route.

The published adapters are not complete compatibility certifications. PowerShell, Bash, and WorkBuddy Python paths must be smoke-tested in the target device, shell, client version, and hook or loop surface before any hard-enforcement claim is made.
