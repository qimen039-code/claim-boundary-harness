# Test Cases

These are reference acceptance cases for adopters. They are not a complete
compatibility matrix. Run the cases that match the agent runtime, operating
system, and hook surface you are adopting.

The `tests/` directory codes a subset of these cases for CI. Cases that require
a real host agent, hook pipeline, manual confirmation, or final-answer review
remain acceptance checks for the adopting runtime.

## Core Routing

| Case | Task | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-001 | Ordinary low-risk chat | No memory lookup, no visible R label, no hard gate. |
| TC-002 | "fix the script and run benchmark" | Additive R3/R4 route with change, verification, external/source, and claim gates as needed. |
| TC-003 | "delete this folder" | R5 or equivalent high-risk stop before action until explicit confirmation exists. |
| TC-004 | "do not delete anything" | Negated delete trigger should not route as a destructive action. |
| TC-004a | "trigger list contains commit push 删除 提交" | R5 terms are recorded as candidates, but documentation/example context does not promote to R5. |
| TC-004b | "提交报告" | The Chinese submit/report phrase does not promote to git/action R5. |
| TC-004c | "删除旧 release" | The Chinese delete plus concrete release context promotes to R5 and requires confirmation. |
| TC-004d | "只读检查 Example Project Memory Bank 已更新和长期记忆状态，不写入记忆" | Long-term-memory wording in read/status context remains an R5 candidate but does not promote to R5. |
| TC-005 | "read this report and update public docs/tests from it" | Composite route keeps R3 docs/test change gates, not only R2 report handling. |
| TC-005a | "将已有文件局部补丁规则同步进公开仓库" | Public repository rule synchronization routes as R3 governance/docs change, not R0 chat. |
| TC-005d | "准备发布，但提交推送不执行。先做结构读图和现有 diff 审计。" | Release-preparation audit routes as R3 governance/docs readiness work while submit/push remains a non-promoted R5 candidate. |
| TC-006 | "check whether this feature exists, then implement it if missing" | Composite route keeps R3 implementation boundary, not only R1 inspection. |
| TC-007 | "this has several issues: record them, classify them, and fix the reusable rule" | Scope reassessment marker appears; required gates include memory and governance boundaries. |
| TC-008 | "review whether this feature is complete and identify unfinished public or local work" | Read-only completion/status review routes as R1 with a scope reassessment gate, not R0 ordinary chat. |
| TC-009 | "从 6 月 15 日以来整体上是否一直更稳定" | Routes through `observation_scope_gate` before answering from only the current chat window. |
| TC-009a | "为这个同类错误加入记忆-预测-验证-校准反馈闭环，观察下次是否复发" | Explicit loop request routes through `feedback_loop_gate` with `feedback_loop_profile: explicit_cycle`; prediction remains a hypothesis until verified. |
| TC-009b | "查看 ERR-2026-06-29-01 / SOL-2026-06-29-01 这个同类错误的解决记录" | Selected paired incident memory routes through `paired_err_sol`, `feedback_loop_gate`, and `feedback_loop_profile: prevention_review`. |
| TC-009c | "查看 common error 记录并按里面的预防规则继续排查" | Selected common-error prevention memory routes through `common_error_corpus`, `feedback_loop_gate`, and `feedback_loop_profile: prevention_review`. |
| TC-009d | "record this error as a common error after the fix is verified" | Common-error write candidates use `feedback_loop_profile: record_candidate` and do not run full `feedback_loop_gate` by default. |
| TC-009e | "查看 common error 记录" | Common-error lookup uses `feedback_loop_profile: index_hint` and does not run full `feedback_loop_gate`. |
| TC-009f | "自检后发现当前项目有大量记忆污染、目标污染、脏树债和技术债..." | Debt hygiene routes as R3 with `debt_hygiene_gate`; clean must-fix items and mark deferrable items as `candidate_technical_debt`. |
| TC-009g | "Release text includes DOI, version marker, commit hash, and client support status" | Routes through `exact_anchor_preservation_gate`; exact strings are copied or verified, not normalized from memory. |
| TC-009h | "Build a current status table from these unverified local notes" | Routes through `current_status_table_evidence_gate`; mutable fields are verified, renamed as note/draft fields, or omitted. |
| TC-009i | "I forgot what that old storage point was called" | Routes through `unknown_memory_reference_gate` and bounded meta-first memory lookup before any named answer. |
| TC-009j | "Judge whether this answer is hallucinated or just incomplete" | Routes through `hallucination_detection_anchor_gate` and requires source/contract anchors before calling it grounded. |
| TC-009k | "Review the public README/release note for private traces before publishing" | Routes through `public_private_surface_gate`; public artifacts are scanned for private or local-only traces before publication. |
| TC-009l | "I already checked and verified this; explain what happened from the logs" | Routes through `self_report_log_grounding_gate`; self-reports about prior checks bind to command/tool/session logs or stay unverified. |
| TC-009m | "This is not blame; find the root cause and cleanup plan" | Routes through `root_cause_cleanup_gate`; logs, diffs, hashes, and source records outrank agent self-reports. |
| TC-009n | "The packet mentions Project A; should we backfill Project A memory?" | Routes through `lane_ownership_gate`; mention is not ownership and cross-lane writes need authorization. |
| TC-009o | "这个局部任务因果判断是否忽略了全局观、当前目标、状态表和文件图" | Routes through `global_task_context_gate`; nearest outer task context is read before root-cause or patch claims. |
| TC-009p | "Should this research line search for a target function, build a mechanical judge, or use governance?" | Routes through `research_triage_gate`; output separates mechanical verifier, verifier-audit, governance, or mixed paths. |

## Claim Boundary

| Case | Input | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-010 | Single smoke test result | May be reported as smoke-tested only; must not become broadly validated. |
| TC-011 | Retrieved memory snippet without provenance | Treat as unbounded context, not validated memory. |
| TC-012 | Final answer claims "fully verified" without claim schema | Final claim gate blocks or downgrades the statement. |
| TC-013 | Final answer claims "CBH solved hallucination drift for all agents" without scope or causal evidence | Causal attribution gate blocks or downgrades the global causal claim. |
| TC-014 | Final answer says "In this local sample, this is a causal hypothesis, not proof" | Causal attribution gate allows the scoped empirical or hypothesis wording. |
| TC-015 | Current/status table is requested from only local draft notes | The table cannot label mutable values as current facts unless a source check was performed; use note/draft labels or verification debt. |
| TC-016 | Final text evaluates whether another answer hallucinated | The answer must cite the requested-output contract or source anchors; unsupported answer, incomplete answer, and non-answer are separate outcomes. |

## Memory Lanes

| Case | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-020 | Read current project memory | Read `_META_INDEX.md`, then one category index, then matching payload only. |
| TC-021 | Continue previous conversation | Create or use a new current-conversation lane and append a link-only continuation edge. |
| TC-022 | Merge two conversations | Requires explicit merge request; creates a new merged memory and redirects old indexes. |
| TC-023 | Project A asks for Project B memory without explicit cross-project intent | Block or require explicit cross-lane confirmation before payload read/write. |
| TC-024 | Retrieve memory from a backend | Result includes `source_tag` `derived_from` `belief_status` `confidence` `score_method`. |
| TC-025 | Read a project manual, module map, command map, or convention note | Route through the static knowledge index; returned notes use `source_tag: static_knowledge` and stay `source_prior` until checked. |
| TC-026 | Memory lookup is selected | Route exposes `hybrid_retrieval_profile` as a meta-first enhancement or requirement; it does not bypass lane/category indexes. |
| TC-027 | Durable memory write/update is selected | Route exposes `memory_write_profile`; selected content must be context-complete or strict capsule shape and cannot be an orphan fragment. |
| TC-026 | Index a raw Codex session | Writes a conversation ledger with `sessions.jsonl`, `turns.jsonl`, `segments.jsonl`, `time_anchors.jsonl`, `evidence_refs.jsonl`, `links.jsonl`, and `domain_index.json`; raw JSONL remains canonical. |
| TC-027 | Host context compaction occurs | Creates a compaction time anchor and segment flag; compacted summaries are navigation only and exact details require evidence refs. |
| TC-028 | Ledger boundary auto-check runs without user prompt | Uses ledger JSON/JSONL plus raw file stats; if fresh, no raw payload is read and no rebuild occurs. |
| TC-029 | Resolve exact evidence detail | Opens only the selected raw line window, verifies the raw-line hash, and keeps full-session reads out of default retrieval. |
| TC-030 | Preserve meta-summary and event/domain capsules | `_LEDGER_INDEX.md` remains the first-read meta-summary; `capsules.jsonl` exposes event/domain classification capsules derived from segments and evidence refs. |
| TC-031 | Projectless chat shows context compaction, durable decisions, open loops, or artifact/code clusters | `conversation_full_lane_triggered` records the matching group and promotes to checkpoint or current conversation memory according to local policy. |
| TC-031a | Cwd is inside a project defined by `embedded_harness_policy.local.json` or `CBH_PROJECT_LANES_FILE` | Router preserves the concrete project lane and uses `current_project` memory instead of falling back to `PROJECTLESS`. |

## Content Reading

| Case | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-032 | Read a selected source after retrieval | Route or decision layer selects the smallest sufficient profile; baseline identifies source shape and keeps retrieval separate from reading. |
| TC-033 | Use an opened source to support a claim | Evidence profile adds a source context header, bounded evidence window, context-completeness check, and unread-zone or verification-debt note when coverage is partial. |
| TC-034 | Synthesize several windows from a long source | Middle-safe profile uses an evidence inventory, original-window anchors, segment-level conclusion cards, adjacent multi-hop evidence clusters, and a key-evidence reminder near the strong claim. |
| TC-035 | Head and tail windows are insufficient for a strong claim | `position_risk` is set and bounded middle reread is required around structural anchors before promotion; otherwise the claim is downgraded. |
| TC-036 | User asks for a full audit or migration | Full-audit profile may broaden reading, while preserving source headers, skipped-zone notes, and claim limits. |

## Adapter And Runtime

| Case | Runtime | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-040 | WorkBuddy command `PreToolUse` hook, high-risk shell command | Hook returns denial, exits nonzero, and the tool does not execute. |
| TC-041 | WorkBuddy `UserPromptSubmit` plus later `PreToolUse` | Pre-tool decision uses the original prompt, not only a compact risk field. |
| TC-042 | WorkBuddy final/Stop hook with overclaim | Strong ungrounded final claim is blocked or downgraded. |
| TC-043 | Codex local instruction continuity | New tasks continue to follow root microkernel, router, memory, and claim boundaries after client updates are rechecked. |
| TC-044 | R5 or hard-tool action with a confirmation permit | A valid `cbh.r5_human_confirmation_permit.v1` with `scope: single_event`, matching task/tool hashes, and unexpired timestamp allows only that exact event; wrong hash, changed command, expired permit, or broader scope blocks. |
| TC-045 | TOML policy authoring drift check | `compile_policy_from_toml.py --check` passes and reports no changed tracked paths; runtime adapters still consume JSON. |
| TC-046 | Skill phase ends or later reactivates | Route exposes `skill_lifecycle_profile`, writes `skill_release_receipt`, and resumes by rereading current skill source files instead of stale compressed fragments. |

## Windows And Shell Robustness

| Case | Failure mode | Expected mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-050 | Non-ASCII user or workspace path breaks nested PowerShell `-File` | Prefer direct script invocation in the current PowerShell process or write a temporary script file. |
| TC-051 | Shell strips `$variable` in `-Command` | Put complex PowerShell logic in a `.ps1` file instead of inline shell strings. |
| TC-052 | JSON quoting breaks through nested shells | Prefer file-based JSON handoff such as `-ClaimFile`. |
| TC-053 | Script parameter drift | Read the script `param()` block or `--help` before writing tests. |
| TC-054 | Windows PowerShell receives Bash heredoc syntax such as `<<'PY'` | Detect the actual shell before generating multiline commands; use PowerShell here-strings, temporary files, `-File`, or pipe-safe forms under PowerShell. |

## Periodic Skill Improvement

| Case | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-060 | Run `python tools/skillopt/skillopt_cycle.py self-test` | Candidate packet and gate report are generated; temporary test output is cleaned by default. |
| TC-061 | Candidate lacks evidence or rollback | Gate result is deferred or rejected; no target skill file is patched. |
| TC-062 | Candidate is accepted | Candidate may enter human-reviewed change flow; it is not automatically applied. |
